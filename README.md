# Homehandy

Homehandy is an android application for domestic services. With the help of Homehandy users can avail domestic services at their fingertips. We have used the android studio as a development tool and Figma for UI design for Homehandy application development. For the backend, we have used Java and the firebase database. We used XML for the front end.
